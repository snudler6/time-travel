# time-travel - time and I/O mocking library
**time-travel** is a python library that allows users to write deterministic
tests for time sensitive and I/O intensive code.

When loaded, the library mocks modules that access the machine's time
(e.g. `time`, `datetime`) and I/O event handlers (e.g. `poll`, `select`) and
replaces them with an internal event-pool implementation that lets the user
choose when time moves forward and which I/O event will happen next.

**time-travel** supports python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and pypy on both Linux
and Windows.

## Quick start

### install

```pip install time_travel```

### Usage

With `time-travel`, the following piece of code runs instantaneously:

```python
from time_travel import TimeTravel

with TimeTravel() as tt:
    tt.clock.time = 100000
    assert time.time() == 100000
    time.sleep(200)
    assert time.time() == 100200
```

`time-travel` also allows you to define I/O event that will "happen":

```python
with TimeTravel() as t:
    sock = socket.socket()
    t.add_future_event(time_from_now=2, sock, t.event_types.select.WRITE)

    now = t.clock.time
    assert select.select([], [sock], []) == ([], [sock], [])
    assert time.time() == now + 2
```
