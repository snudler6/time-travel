time-travel - time and I/O mocking library
==========================================

**time-travel** is a python library that allows users to write deterministic
tests for time sensitive and I/O intensive code.

When loaded, the library mocks modules that access the machine's time
(e.g. ``time``, ``datetime``) and I/O event handlers (e.g. ``poll``, ``select``)
and replaces them with an internal event-pool implementation that lets the user
choose when time moves forward and which I/O event will happen next.

Imagine testing a state machine that changes states a certain amount of time
passes. One way to test it would be:

.. code-block:: python

   def test_state_timeout():
       sm.handle_event(event=...)
       time.sleep(5)
       sm.handle_event(event=...)
       assert sm.state == TIMEOUT

This is bad for several reasons. First, **your test takes 5 seconds to run**.
Second, ``time.sleep()`` isn't accurate and this test might fail randomly.
There's nothing worse than a Heisenbuild. Well, perhaps a **SLOW** Heisenbuild.

Here's the **better** way to do this using `time-travel`:

.. code-block:: python

   def test_state_timeout():
       with TimeTravel() as tt:
           sm.handle_event(event=...)
           tt.clock.time += 5
           sm.handle_event(event=...)
           assert sm.state == TIMEOUT

Your test is now accurate, immediate and consistent.

**time-travel** supports python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and pypy on both Linux
and Windows.

Quick start
-----------

Install
^^^^^^^

.. code::

   pip install time_travel

Usage
^^^^^

With `time-travel`, the following piece of code runs instantaneously:

.. code-block:: python

   from time_travel import TimeTravel

   with TimeTravel() as tt:
       tt.clock.time = 100000
       assert time.time() == 100000
       time.sleep(200)
       assert time.time() == 100200

`time-travel` also allows you to define I/O event that will "happen"
during the program:

.. code-block:: python

   with TimeTravel() as t:
       sock = socket.socket()
       t.add_future_event(time_from_now=2, sock, t.event_types.select.WRITE)

       now = t.clock.time
       assert select.select([], [sock], []) == ([], [sock], [])
       assert time.time() == now + 2
