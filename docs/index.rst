# time-travel - time and I/O mocking library

## Usage

`TimeTravel` is context manager patching all* time and I\O related modules in a 
single line. 

\* All modules currently patched :).

The initial time within the time travel context manager is set to 
86,400.0 seconds in order to support windows (this is the lowest acceptable 
value by the OS). This value is exported via ``time_travel.MIN_START_TIME``.

In order to improve TimeTravel's performance, you can give it the names of 
modules you want to patch (in list, tuple or single name). 
If you want to patch the current module, you can use the local 
variable `__name__`.

### Examples

#### Skip timeouts

Tests are deterministic and take no time with time travel. For example:

```python
with TimeTravel():  
    assert time.time() == 86400
    time.sleep(200)
    assert time.time() == 86600    
```

```python
with TimeTravel(modules_to_patch=__name__):
    assert datetime.today() == datetime.fromtimestamp(86400)
    time.sleep(250)
    assert datetime.today() == datetime.fromtimestamp(86650)
```

```python
import module1
import module2

with TimeTravel(modules_to_patch=['module1', 'module2']) as time_machine:
    time_machine.set_time(100000)
    module1.very_long_method()
    module2.time_sensitive_method()
```

#### Patching event based modules

Can Patch and determine future events for event based modules using select:

```python
with TimeTravel() as t:
    sock = socket.socket()
    t.add_future_event(2, sock, t.event_types.select.WRITE)
    
    now = t.clock.time
    assert select.select([], [sock], []) == ([], [sock], [])
    assert time.time() == now + 2
    assert datetime_cls.today() == datetime_cls.fromtimestamp(now + 2)
```

Or using ``poll`` (for supported platforms only):

```python
with TimeTravel() as t:
    sock = socket.socket()
    t.add_future_event(2, sock, select.POLLIN)
    
    poll = select.poll()
    poll.register(sock, select.POLLIN | select.POLLOUT)
    
    now = t.clock.time
    assert poll.poll() == [(sock, select.POLLIN)]
    assert time.time() == now + 2
```

## List of currently patched modules and functions

- time.time
- time.sleep
- datetime.date.today
- datetime.datetime.today
- datetime.datetime.now
- datetime.datetime.utcnow
- select.select
- select.poll (for supported platforms only)

### Add your own patches to time-travel

time-travel uses python "entry points" to add external patches to it.

#### Example
my_new_patcher.py:
```python
from time_travel.patchers.basic_patcher import BasicPatcher

class MyNewPatcher(BasicPatcher):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass
```

To add the new patcher automatically to time-travel, only add the new class to the "time_travel.patchers" entry point in your setup.py:

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name=...
    .
    .
    .
    entry_points={
        'time_travel.patchers' : [
            'my_new_patcher = my_new_patcher:MyNewPatcher',
        ],
    }
)
```

The class should do 1 of 2 things:

1. Override and implement it's own `start` and `stop` of the patcher.
2. Inherit BasePatcher, Implement `get_patched_module` and `get_patch_actions`:
   * `get_patched_module` return the actual module patched by the patcher.
   * `get_patch_actions` return a list containing 
     `(object_name, the_real_object, fake_object)`
     where the object name is the object's name in the patched module and it
     will be replaced by the fake object.
     e.g.:

```python

from time_travel.patchers import BasePatcher
import time

class TimePatcher(BasePatcher):
    def get_patched_module(self):
        return time
        
    def get_patch_actions(self):
        return [('time', time.time, lambda: return 0)]
```
